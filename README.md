# KVContestDatasetGenerator
My attempt on simple command-key-value dataset generator.

Usage:

Simply run ./main.py to generate dataset.
Enter number of rows.
Type 'yes' to save dataset.
Enter name of new file without extension.
If file already exists, you will be prompted for better name.
Type 'yes' to save solution.
Again type name of file.

To compare files:

On Windows:
Drop two files onto file_comparator/main.py
If that doesn't work, enter full path of main.py in quotes into file_comparator/file_comparator.bat instead of "main.py"
Type name of mode - 'output' - for saving differences to file.
Or 'print' for only console.

On linux:
Simply drop two files onto main.py
